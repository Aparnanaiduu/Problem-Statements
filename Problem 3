Golang Web App with Docker & Kubernetes
Step 1:
I wrote a Golang program that shows the current date and time on a simple web page.
I uploaded this code to GitHub.
Then, I created a Docker image for it and pushed it to DockerHub.
Basically, I containerized a small web app that only shows date and time.
Step 2:
I used Kubernetes to deploy this Docker container.
I followed the declarative approach by writing a deployment YAML file.
I made sure it runs with 2 replicas, so itâ€™s always available.
Step 3:
Finally, I exposed this app to the internet using a Kubernetes service, so anyone can access it online.
