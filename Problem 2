Kubernetes Security Scan

Steps I Followed:
1. I installed a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube on my system.
2. Once the setup was done, I used a tool called Kubescape to scan the cluster for any security issues or misconfigurations.
3. After the scan, Kubescape gave me a report of the findings.
4. I saved that output as a JSON file, which includes all the issues found during the scan.
